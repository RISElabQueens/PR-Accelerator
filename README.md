# Usage

1. To run _PR-Accelerator_ you need to provide a _GitHub personal access token_ (API key). You can follow the instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token) to obtain such a token.

2. Install the python packages listed in the requirements.txt:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the following command

```
git clone https://github.com/RISElabQueens/PR-Accelerator.git
```

4. To get pull request data run the following command

```
python3 pr_getdata.py end_date num_days owner repo github_token
```

> Example: python3 pr_getdata.py 2023-04-30 7 huggingface transformers xxxxx

***This would fetch pull request data from the "transformers" repository owned by "huggingface" for pull requests created in the last 7 days and including 2023-04-30***

Note: The above command will generate three csv files (pr_comment_enddate.csv, pr_review_enddate.csv and pr_summary_enddate.csv). You need to provide the path of these csv files in pr_initial_interaction_analytics.py file.

5. To get the initial analytics of a PR run the following command:

```
python3 pr_initial_interaction_analytics.py -output "pr_initial_analytics.csv"
```
